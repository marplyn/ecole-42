## <code>about</code>
this repository contains 42cursus projects at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) programming school ([21 School](https://21-school.ru) in Russia)

---

## <code>first step: [picsine](https://github.com/marplyn/piscine-42)</code>
> Rather than offering a straight computer initiation, the Piscine at 42 lets you start the curriculum with intensive training in C, the first language you have to use during the training course. For one month, the Piscine at 42 lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy.

see all completed projects and subjects of the piscine [here](https://github.com/marplyn/piscine-42)

## <code>documentation</code>
* [subjects](/documentation/subjects) of the cursus
* the [Norm](/documentation/en_norm.pdf): describes the applicable programming standard at 42 to follow when writing code (see the source code of the Normenette client [here](https://github.com/42School/norminette))

### [Libft](/Libft)
#### Your very first own library
> This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.
```trace
initial_errors: | test_ft_isalnum: OK | test_ft_isalpha: OK | test_ft_isascii: OK | test_ft_isdigit: OK | test_ft_isprint: OK | test_ft_atoi: OK | test_ft_bzero: OK | test_ft_calloc: OK | test_ft_itoa: OK | test_ft_memchr: OK | test_ft_memcmp: OK | test_ft_memcpy: OK | test_ft_memmove: OK | test_ft_memset: OK | test_ft_putchar_fd: OK | test_ft_putendl_fd: OK | test_ft_putnbr_fd: OK | test_ft_putstr_fd: OK | test_ft_split: OK | test_ft_strchr: OK | test_ft_strdup: OK | test_ft_strjoin: OK | test_ft_strlcat: OK | test_ft_strlcpy: OK | test_ft_strlen: OK | test_ft_strmapi: OK | test_ft_striteri: OK | test_ft_strncmp: OK | test_ft_strnstr: OK | test_ft_strrchr: OK | test_ft_strtrim: OK | test_ft_substr: OK | test_ft_tolower: OK | test_ft_toupper: OK | bonus: KO (Does not compile)
```
✅ success 100/100

### [get_next_line](/get_next_line)
#### Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious
> The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.
```trace
basic_tests: GNL OK | bonus_tests: GNL KO
```
✅ success 100/100

### [ft_printf](/ft_printf)
#### Because putnbr and putstr aren’t enough
> This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future projects without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.
```trace
test_spdxiucpercent: 8/8 correct functions | bonus_one: KO (Does not compile) | bonus_two: KO (Does not compile)
```
✅ success 100/100

### [Born2beRoot](/Born2beRoot)
> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

✅ success 100/100

### [push_swap](/push_swap)
#### Because Swap_push isn’t as natural
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

✅ success 102/100

### [pipex](/pipex)
> This project aims to make you understand a bit deeper two concepts that you already know: the redirections and the pipes. It is an introduction project.

✅ success 125/100

### [so_long](/so_long)
#### And thanks for all the fish!
> This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

✅ success 125/100

### [Philosophers](/Philosophers)
#### I never thought philosophy would be so deadly
> Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

✅ success 125/100

### [miniRT](/miniRT) (with @llirrikk)
> This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.

✅ success 103/100
