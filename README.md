## <code>about</code>
This repository contains my completed 42cursus projects at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) programming school ([21 School](https://21-school.ru) in Russia).

---

## <code>first step: [picsine](https://github.com/marplyn/piscine-42)</code>
> Rather than offering a straight computer initiation, the Piscine at 42 lets you start the curriculum with intensive training in C, the first language you have to use during the training course. For one month, the Piscine at 42 lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy.

See all completed projects and subjects of the piscine [here](https://github.com/marplyn/piscine-42)

### [CPP Module](/CPP%20Module/)
These modules are the introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.

#### [00](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2000/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2000.pdf)*
> Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

#### [01](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2001/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2001.pdf)*
> Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.

#### [02](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2002/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2002.pdf)*
> Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.

#### [03](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2003/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2003.pdf)*
> Inheritance.

#### [04](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2004/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2004.pdf)*
> Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.

#### [05](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2005/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2005.pdf)*
> Repetition and Exceptions.

#### [06](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2006/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2006.pdf)*
> C++ casts.

#### [07](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2007/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2007.pdf)*
> C++ templates.

#### [08](/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2008/)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/CPP%20Module/CPP%20Module%2008.pdf)*
> Templated containers, iterators, algorithms.


### [miniRT](/miniRT) (with [@llirrikk](https://github.com/llirrikk))
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/miniRT.pdf)*
> This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.


### [Philosophers](/Philosophers)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/Philosophers.pdf)*
> Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.


### [so_long](/so_long)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/so_long.pdf)*
> This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.


### [pipex](/pipex)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/pipex.pdf)*
> This project aims to make you understand a bit deeper two concepts that you already know: the redirections and the pipes. It is an introduction project.


### [push_swap](/push_swap)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/push_swap.pdf)*
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.


### [Born2beRoot](/Born2beRoot)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/Born2beRoot.pdf)*
> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.


### [ft_printf](/ft_printf)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/ft_printf.pdf)*
> This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future projects without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.


### [get_next_line](/get_next_line)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/get_next_line.pdf)*
> The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.


### [Libft](/Libft)
*[subject](/documentation/subjects/Libft.pdf)*
> This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.
